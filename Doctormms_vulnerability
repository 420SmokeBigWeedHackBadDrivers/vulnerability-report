Doctormms v1.0 (https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14182/doctor-appointment-system.html) was discovered to contain a SQL injection vulnerability via the $userid parameter at myAppoinment.php.

24.	$sql = " SELECT * FROM booking WHERE userid='".$_SESSION["userid"]."'";
25.	$result = mysqli_query($conn,$sql);
26.	$count = mysqli_num_rows($result);

At line 24 of the code, the value of $_SESSION["userid"] is passed directly into the SQL statement, and a query is performed at line 25, which will result in a database leak. 
The attacker stores admin' or 1=1 # into the session, at which point the SQL statement executed is SELECT * FROM booking WHERE userid='admin' or 1=1 #', which will result in the loss of all data for booking. 
Similarly, the attacker deposits 1'; system shutdown;# into session, which still causes the database to shut down.
